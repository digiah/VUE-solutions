# Windows Portable suitable for virtualization.

The goal is an entirely self-contained version that has no outside dependencies besides what a stock windows OS provides. This is the version I would then use to virtualize if I found a hosted windows VM.

The current version still needs java to be installed.  I thought I had it, but when I tried it on a VM with no java, it failed. :(

There is not really a need for this, as installer-VUE works fine and I will prefer a linux-based cloud solution if I can, so this is lower priority for now. But if you want it it is an almost-portable app that will run as long as you have an appropriate java installed.
