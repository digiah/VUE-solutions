# VUE-solutions
Solve various vue (Visual Understanding Environment) problems.

1. Linux: Build a version of VUE that can be placed in `/usr/bin` and has an associated `.desktop` file so that it registers with desktop launchers and and can be used for file associations so that `.vue` and `.vpk` files can be double clicked to open them in VUE.  See [./Linux/README-Linux.md](./Linux/README-Linux.md)

2. MacOS Catalina: Workaround to use VUE in Catalina. See [./Mac Catalina/README-Mac.md](./MacOS%20Catalina/README-Mac.md) 

3. Windows: Portable, self contained `.exe` file. See [./windows portable/README-Win.md](./windows%20portable/README-Win.md)
